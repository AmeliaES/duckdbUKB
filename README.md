# duckdbUKB

## Description

The duckdbUKB package is an R package that allows you to query the UK Biobank duckdb database. It provides a convenient way to retrieve and analyze data from the UK Biobank using SQL queries.
The main object returned is a flat table. This is table where each row is a person and each column is a variable.

**I'm still in the process of building this package, so installation doesn't work yet. Please see [worked_example.md](worked_example.md) and [worked_example.R](worked_example.md) if you are needing data from UK Biobank in the meantime.**
